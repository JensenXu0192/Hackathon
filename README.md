# Hackathon


This predictive model has achieved the third hightest score in the 2019 Beedie Hackathon hosted by Simon Fraser University. 
However, another team who had the same score as ours was announced as the third place and our team was not regarded.
The debate is still unsettled.


The complete model is in the "code" file. The csv files are the data provided and used in this Hackathon.


Note: the model was finished by 3 team members, so the coding style is not uniform.
